# Test Scene 1 
# A simple quad viewed from different camera positions

size 640 480 

# Now specify the camera.  This is what you should implement.
# This file has 4 camera positions.  Render your scene for all 4.

# lighting/material definitions
# for initial testing, you should get the geometry right
# you may want to use dummy (constant) shading, ignoring these lines

# Now specify the geometry 
# Again, for initial testing, maybe you want to implement a dummy 
# ray-plane intersection routine, instead of reading this fully.
# Though it's probably simpler you just implement this, for later 
# parts of the assignment.
